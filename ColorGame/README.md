# ColorGame program 
## This is the first program in the side project which entails creating a Web Program using Javascript. 
## Of course, front-end material is still the focus here. 
> This simple program will start off with a RGB value in form, rgb(red value, green value, blue value) for player to guess. 
> CSS transition effect and border-radius are being explored and applied in this simple program. 
> The color of the squares and the buttons fades out in the "stripe" in white which takes up the entire row of the window. 
> The color of the squares are randomized when the webpage reloads and one of the game mode buttons selected and the new game 
> button is clicked. A screenshot of the initial webpage load is shown:
