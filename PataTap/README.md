# PataTap Clone Project 
## Motivation:
 * Get familiarity with Paper.js and Howler.js and sound from Neuronal Synchrony, or learn to use third-party libraries
## Description
> This is a follow-along project ([course link](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)).
> The main structure of the code is the same but with some twist of mine. I added a grid of randomized 
> circles / rectangles centered on the canvas. 
## How to run this program on Mac OS: 
    > To fix the Cross Origin Errors when launching up the web app, use the terminal to run a python local server and then start up the web app that way. See steps:
    >  Direct your path to the project folder in the terminal run : ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
    >  Open up the browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
    >  select the circles.html file
